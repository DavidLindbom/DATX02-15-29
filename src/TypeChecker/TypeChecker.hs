-- Hopper using the Hindley-Milner (HM) type system.
-- It is a type system for lambda calculus with parametric polymorphism.
-- The programmer does not need to give any type signatures, the algorithm can
-- reconstruct (infer) the type of any expression in the language. Instead type
-- signatures are used as a means of specification.  (Types as specification).
-- "The purpose of the notion [of type] in functional programming is to assure
-- us at compile-time that a program will not 'go wrong' [at run-time], where
-- we do not count a program to have gone wrong if it does not terminate,
-- or a function is applied to arguments for which it has not been defined."
-- - The Implementation of Functional Programming Languages, p. 162
-- To 'go wrong' we need to add the 'recieve' construct (and others?) for which
-- we do not know the type of the recieved data until runtime.
-- A type system is a formal system where type checking amounts to proving the
-- type of an expression. (Inference rules, judgments)
-- Based on "Algorithhm W Step by Step" by Martin GrabmÃ¼ller available at
